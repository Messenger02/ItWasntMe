# ItWasntMe
Exploring network traffic analysis and threat detection using Wireshark. Inspired by learning from CodePath
## Project Overview
Initially was going to use VMWare for this project, but my professor mentioned that there was real malware in the PCAP files and that POSSIBLY infect my computer. Better safe than sorry. Instead, I was provided to use an AzureLab. Using a Linux VM to use Wireshark. I would download three PCAP files. I would analyze each file to find evidence of a malicous user sending spam emails. The first thing that i did that was helpful was using filters. I know emails are sent via TCP. I used TCP to narrow my search. 
## Goals & Learning Outcomes
Find evidence of malicious user sending spam emails. I learned how to utilize filter to narrow my search
## challenges & Solutions
At first, It was a lot to analyze. Luckily, I used ChatGPT to understand that I could use the filter. 
## Technical Details
There was a chance that malware could spread to my computer if using a hypervisor (VMWare). Instead I use Azure Labs to conduct my project.
## Future improvemnt
